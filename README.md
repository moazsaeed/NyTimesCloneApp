## Discussions

I have used `UIKit` for user interface creation, `RxSwift` allows me to use features like Observable, Relays, publishers and subscribers. Used `MVVM` Architectural design pattern is for modularized, maintainable and decoupled Codeing, easy to test, Bindings make UI updates easier to handle etc.
